    <h1>Digital Cities and the Welfare Structure</h1>

    <p>A summation of contributing factors that make up a smart city.</p>
     <h3>Smart city initiatives do not limit themselves to improving the efficiency of existing cities, but also aim to build completely new cities and neighborhoods. In 2016 Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Google/Alphabet, proposed to build a completely new part of Toronto with smart city technology from the ground up. A steady stream of proposed smart city initiatives, such as Net City (China), Telosa (U.S), The Line (Saudi Arabia), arguably demonstrate the ambition to integrate digital technology into the city and bridge the gap between the virtual and the physical realms. 
        In this article we are going to evaluate a hypothetical proposal to build a smart city neighborhood in Oslo.
        </h3>
    <h3>Identifying the situation</h3>
     <p>The case is that a company fronting as an infrastructural development company, in reality wishes 
        to collect data on inhabitants of an area. This is done through smart technology and modern services/
        sensor technology. The goal of the data collection is not stated, and as such is a privacy concern. 
        This is relevant to our future careers in the ways of: job opportunity (we’ll have more work) ethical 
        developments (the new technology might set a precedent for the future of the tech industry) technical 
        development (new technologies might be developed and utilized). </p> 
    <h3>Our immediate reactions</h3>
    <p>Jobs will be replaced. Older professions will die out with time as they are replaced by new jobs. AI can 
    do data entry faster than an accountant for example. Cars will drive themselves. Home offices might prevail
     over in-office work, creating less demand for public transport. Environmental concerns: will this harm the 
     environment? How much resources does it require to create a smart city like this? Will it be pretty? Architectural 
     trends will change with time and traditional architecture will disappear in light of new “modern” buildings. Just 
     look at Bjørvika compared to Grønland. </p>

     <h3>Three positive aspects</h3>
     <p>The affordable housing will benefit lower income people, such as students. This will create a subculture of people who live in Grønlikaia and can strengthen their communal bond. 
        Smart technology might make life easier. Solar powered houses, predicting algorithms to make safer roads, smarter streetlights to improve pedestrian crossings. Such improvements could make life “smarter” and easier for the people who live there. 
        Better use of space. Building taller housing units makes more space for places such as parks, recreational areas, playgrounds, plazas or shops.  </p>
    <h3>Three negative aspects</h3>
    <p>Price. The project will certainly be expensive. If a smart city is funded through taxpayer money, those who don’t live in it might be jealous and unhappy with how their taxes are spent to increase the quality of life of other people, not themselves. 
        Monopolizing and control. A singular company controlling all the smart technology is not democratically sound. The concept of “Big Brother” applies here as they would be able to shut down activities, they deem unsavory.
        Privacy and collection of personal data. The signed waiver required to live in the proposed smart city would need to include a section about how the denizen’s data is handled and used. </p>
    <h3>Will this make society and the city better or worse?</h3>
    <p>The future will show the results, but we think this could be a benefit for society; only if living under surveillance is a choice. People who don’t wish to have their data collected and monitored should have the option to opt
         out, while those who are fine with it should have that opportunity. As long as this project is done in a good, ethical way and improvements are made according to citizens wishes, it could be used to improve future smart technology 
         and give people living in it opportunities that we don’t yet have in day-to-day life. Privacy concerns will need to be addressed and transparency from the company side is a must. But as long as this happens in a “good” way we are fine with the implementation of the project. </p>
